 non-exclusive license:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 .
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 .
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
 BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED

   other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
   work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic
   work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations
   or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
   including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
   a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
   for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
   Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
   the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
   considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   .
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
   encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
   or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
   below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
   contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included
   in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
   contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
   themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
   that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License.
   .
   c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
   http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
   Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
   including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
   have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
   License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
   works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
   Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
   License.
   .
   d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
   copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
   transfer of ownership.

   the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if
   no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition

   and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
   otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
   (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
   entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
   (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
   broadcast.
   .
   h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
   of this License including without limitation any production in the
   literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form
   of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and
   other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
   nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
   entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;
   a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
   process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
   architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to
   which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
   photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
   three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or
   science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to
   the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
   a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered
   a literary or artistic work.
   .
   i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
   respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
   Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
   violation.
   .
   j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
   to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
   process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
   performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that

   individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
   means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
   of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
   rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
   .
   k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including

   .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise
 the rights in the Work as stated below:
   .
   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   .
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
   including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
   label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
   original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
   work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
   indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   .
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
   in Collections; and,
   .
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   .
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:
   .
  i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
  licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
  right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License;
  .
  ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
  the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
  licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
  to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
  under this License; and,
  .
  iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
  member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
  granted under this License.
  .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
 or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
 by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
   .
   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
   this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
   Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
   the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
   recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
   under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
   keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
   of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
   impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
   ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted
   to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
   applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
   require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
   the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
   any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
   Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You
   create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
   extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
   Section 4(c), as requested.
   .
   b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
   terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
   same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
   jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
   contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
   Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
   License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned
   in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
   the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i),
   (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms
   of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You
   must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every
   copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may
   not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of
   the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
   to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to
   the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
   of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,
   You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation
   that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
   exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
   incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
   apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
   Applicable License.
   .
   c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
   or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
   Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
   reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
   Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
   Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
   a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
   ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
   or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
   title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
   the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
   unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
   information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the
   case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
   Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
   or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
   required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
   provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
   minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
   of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
   in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
   contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
   credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
   manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
   You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
   sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
   Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
   without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
   Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   .
   d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
   or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
   derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
   the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
   jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
   Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
   deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
   action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
   Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
   fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
   reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right
   to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
   .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
 IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
 SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
   .
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
   Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
   You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
   provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
   those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination
   of this License.
   .
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
   Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
   time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
   this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
   granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
   in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
   .
 8. Miscellaneous
   .
   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
   the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
   terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   .
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
   and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   .
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
   parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   .
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
   signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   .
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
   respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
   or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
   shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
   communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
   mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   .
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
   the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
   1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
   WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
   Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
   subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
   License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
   provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
   applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
   applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
   License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
   this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
   applicable law.

License: OFL-1.1
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
 creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
 provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
 improved in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any
 reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and
 derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
 license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does
 not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives.
 .

License: Freeware-License-v1.00
 This font was found on the internet and did not come with a
 license. While we try to make sure that all the fonts on
 fontsquirrel.com are properly licensed for commercial use, there are
 many fonts that have either been abandoned by their authors or the
 authors distribute their fonts without an explicit license.
 .
 It is our opinion that if the unlicensed font is freely available for
 download from either the original source or from multiple free-font
 sites then we assume it to be safe to use the font commercially. This
 is no guarantee of such freedom, but there are so many unlicensed
 free fonts distributed by primary sources that the intentions must be
 read that the font is free to use how you like.
 .
 We are not lawyers and don’t pretend to be them on TV. Please report
